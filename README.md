## Summary of the project: 
This repository explorers topics such as customer conversion, measuring social network effect through statistical testing, logistic regression and propensity score matching technique in data science to suggest optimal paid customer conversion (growth) strategy for an online music platform “HighNote”.

## Code & Article contents 
1. Data cleaning
2. Exploratory Data analysis 
  - Summary statistics
  - T-test to observe difference between paid users and free users
  - Visualization : Correaltion between variables, other graphs comparing paid user group and free user group
3. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) Analysis
  - To test whether having paid-subscriber friends affects the likelihood of converting a free user to a paid user using matchit package
  - Compare matched and raw data, Treated data and control data
  - Examine the covariate balance in matched sample using difference in means test
4. Logistic Regression analysis
  - to identify the relationship and significance between observed factors and likelyhood of becoming a paid user and to measure the impact
  - to find odds ratio to interperet the contribution of each significant factor to convert a free user to a paid one
